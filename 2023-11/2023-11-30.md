Our objectives on 30th of November 2023 are:

:pencil: Document how Kodiak projects set version, build and build metadata.

:pencil: Develop a CI / CD approach covering all defined branches.

Kodiak Web Client:

Branch   Action
feat/*   *
=> backup and exchange only

dev          pull merge
=> build with build number
=> store artifact
=> trigger kodiak-web-server with dev => publish image:dev in registry

rel/*.*.*    create branch, push
=> build with build number
=> store artifact
=> trigger kodiak-web-server with rel/* => publish image:rel/* in registry

main         not pull, but create tag v/*.*.*
=> build with build number
=> store artifact
=> trigger kodiak-web-server with v/*.*.* => publish image:v/*.*.* und :latest in registry

patch/*.*.*  create branch, push
=> build with build number
=> store artifact
=> trigger kodiak-web-server with patch/*.*.* => publish image:patch/*.*.* in registry
