Our objectives on 26th of November 2023 are:

:pencil: Develop a GitHub Action which derives VERSION_STRING as env variable from version tag.

:pencil: Differentiate two ways of setting the version string: when VERSION_STRING is set and when it is not.

With VERSION_STRING set => VERSION_STRING-BUILD_NUMBER  (with 0+local as DEFAULT for BUILD_NUMBER).

With VERSION_STRING not set => 0.0.0-BUILD_NUMBER+local (with 0 as DEFAULT for BUILD_NUMBER)

Open question: how to tell if build is within CI /CD?
